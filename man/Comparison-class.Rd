\title{Contains a comparison between two layers}
\description{
This object is produced as the result of a call to the functions \link{compareLayers} and shouldn't be directly created by a user.
 
It contains a data slot with each of the compared layers, a list containing  various statistical metrics, 
meta-data about the source of the two compared layers and spatio-temporal meta-data describing where the comparison is valid.
}
\details{
It can be plotted by functions \link{plotSpatialComparison} and \link{plotTemporalComparison}.
   
Generally these are not created directly by the user, but rather by the function \link{compareLayers}.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{id}}{A unique character string to identify this particular vegetation object.  Recommended to be alphanumeric because it is used to construct file names.}

\item{\code{name}}{A character string describing this comparison layer, is automatically generated}

\item{\code{type}}{A character string describing what type of comparisons this is (automatically determined).  Can be
\itemize{
 \item{"continuous"}{A comparison of two continous, numerical layers.}
 \item{"categorical"}{A comparison of two categorical layers.}
 \item{"relative.abundance"} {A comparison of multiple numerical layers whose sum equals unity.}
 \item{"seasonal"} {A comparison of the seasonal concentration and phase calculated from two numerical layers which have monthly data.}
}}

\item{\code{data}}{A data.table object.  This is used because is it very much faster for calculations that data.frame or raster layers.}

\item{\code{quant1}}{A \linkS4class{Quantity} object to define what quantity the data from first field represents}

\item{\code{quant2}}{A \linkS4class{Quantity} object to define what quantity the data from second field represents}

\item{\code{layers1}}{A character string (or vector thereof) of the layer(s) from the first field that were compared}

\item{\code{layers2}}{A character string (or vector thereof) of the layer(s) from the second field that were compared}

\item{\code{stats}}{A simple R list containing the (named) statistics produced by the comparison (very flexible, items will depend on the type of comparison done and
can even be a another list)}

\item{\code{source1}}{A \linkS4class{Source} object describing the source of the first layer in the comparison}

\item{\code{source2}}{A \linkS4class{Source} object describing the source of the second layer in the comparison}

\item{\code{sta.info1}}{The \linkS4class{STAInfo} object for the first field}

\item{\code{sta.info2}}{The \linkS4class{STAInfo} object for the second field}
