\item{year.aggregate.method}{Character, method by which this Field was temporally aggregated (if not temporally averaged leave blank of use "none")}

\value{
A character string

\description{
Given a string for the quantity and temporal and spatial extents and averaging flags, build an appropriate (and unique) ID string
for use in the \code{id} slot of a \code{Field} and for filenames etc.
