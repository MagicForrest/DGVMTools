\usage{
plotSubannual(
  fields,
  layers = NULL,
  title = NULL,
  subtitle = NULL,
  plotAverage = TRUE,
  text.multiplier = NULL,
  plot = TRUE,
  year.col.gradient = NULL,
  alpha = 0.2,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fields}{The data to plot. Can be a Field or a list of Fields.}

\item{layers}{A list of strings specifying which layers to plot.  Defaults to all layers.}

\item{title}{A character string to override the default title.}

\item{subtitle}{A character string to override the default subtitle.}

\item{plotAverage}{Boolean, if TRUE plot the mean of all years}

\item{text.multiplier}{A number specifying an overall multiplier for the text on the plot.
Make it bigger if the text is too small on large plots and vice-versa.}

\item{plot}{Boolean, if FALSE return a data.table with the final data instead of the ggplot object.  This can be useful for inspecting the structure of the facetting columns, amongst other things.}

\item{year.col.gradient}{A colour palette as a function to use to colour the annual lines according to their Year.  Only works for a single Quantity and a single Source.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric (range 0-1), to give the transparency (alpha) of the annual lines}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to \code{ggplot2::facet_wrap()}.  See the ggplot2 documentation for full details but the following are particularly useful.
\itemize{
 \item{"nrow"}{The number of rows of facets}
 \item{"ncol"}{The number of columns of facets}
 \item{"scales"}{Whether the scales (ie. x and y ranges) should be fixed for all facets.  Options are "fixed" (same scales on all facets, default)
 "free" (all facets can their x and y ranges), "free_x" and "free_y"  (only x and y ranges can vary, respectively).}
 \item{"labeller"}{A function to define the labels for the facets.  This is a little tricky, please look to the ggplot2 documentation} 
}}
}
\value{
Returns either a ggplot2 object or a data.table (depending on the 'plot' argument)
}
\description{
For a list of Fields, plots the sub-annual cycles of the selected layers on on top of each other.
}
\details{
Note that like all \code{DGVMTools} plotting functions, \code{plotSubannual} splits the data into separate panels using the \code{ggplot2::facet_wrap()}.  If you want to 'grid' the facets
using \code{ggplot2::facet_grid()} you can do so afterwards. 'gridding the facets' implies the each column and row of facets vary by one specific aspect.
For example you might have one column for each Source, and one row for each "Quantity".
