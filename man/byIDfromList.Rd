\title{Retrieves an object from a list based on it's \code{id} slot}
\usage{
byIDfromList(id, list)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{The id sought (must be string)}

\item{list}{The list to be scanned (must be a list)}
}
\value{
The matching object from the list or NULL.  If NULL it will give a message and a warning, the following code will probably fail.
}
\description{
Looks through a list of arbitary object until it finds one which has a slot called "id" whose value matches the imput argument.
The idea is that you can use this function to pull a particular Layer from a list of Layer objects, or a particular run from a list of Source objects etc.
