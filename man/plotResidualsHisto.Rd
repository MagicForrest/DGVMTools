\title{Plot the residuals from a Comparison or list of Comparisons as histogram}
\usage{
plotResidualsHisto(comparisons, cols = NULL, fills = NULL,
  types = NULL, labels = NULL, title = NULL, xlab = NULL,
  ylab = NULL, alpha = NULL, reverse = FALSE, bin.width = NULL,
  xlim = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{comparisons}{The Comparison or Comparisons for which to plot the residuals}

\item{cols, types, fills}{Vector of line colours, line types and fill colours respectively. Each can be left empty but if defined they must have one entry for each set of residuals you are plotting.}

\item{labels}{Vector of character for label the histos. Can be left empty (defaults to the run id) but if defined it must have one entry for each set of residuals you are plotting.}

\item{title}{Character for plot title (optional)}

\item{xlab}{Character for x-axis label (optional)}

\item{ylab}{Character for y-axis label (optional)}

\item{alpha}{Numerical value [0,1] to specify opacity of histo fill colours (optional)}

\item{reverse}{Logical if TRUE reverse the layering of the histograms (optional, default = FALSE)}

\item{bin.width}{Numeric, width of bins on histogram (can be left blank)}

\item{xlim}{Numeric, if provided should be a vector of two values defining the range on the x-axis}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 plot.
}
\description{
Function will overlay histograms if more than one Comparison is provided.  
Line colours, line types and fill colours can all be specified but have sensible defaults.
}
\details{
This function should be called on the Comparison objects produced by a call to function compareLayers().  It plots the residuals for each Comparison.
